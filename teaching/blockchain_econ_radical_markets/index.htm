    "Blockchain by itself isn't transformational, however it is foundational."
    (Tom Golway)

    <h3 class="sec_header">Blockhain Economic and Radical Markets</h3>

    This seminar is composed of two interlocking parts:

    <br/><br/>
    <ol>
        <li>Part 1: Students will learn about the blockchain technology, what it is and what new economic and governance possibilities is enabling for individuals, firms, organizations and national states.</li>
        <li>Students will learn about the novel, critical solutions to "radically" redesign our socio-economic systems introduced in the book by Eric Posner and Glen Weyl, Radical Markets: Uprooting Capitalism and Democracy for a Just Society, and evolved into the RadicalXchange social movement.</li>
    </ol>
    <br/>

    The goal of this seminar is to creatively combine insights from both parts to generate innovative solutions to address some of the shortcomings of current socio-economic systems. Students are required to submit a mid-term presentation and a final presentation, plus a final project in one of the formats described in this document.

    <h4>Blockchain Economics</h4>

    The blockchain is a global technology which aims to revolutionize several areas of society by extending its tenets of decentralization, transparency, and verifiability to domains in which it was previously impossible or impractical. The blockchain popularity is often associated and confused with that of Bitcoin, however Bitcoin is just its oldest application, alongside many other promising ones.

    For instance, the blockchain technology can enormously reduce frictional costs of financial services, eliminating the "middle-man” costs and allowing seemingly instantaneous payments across the globe just for fractional fees. The blockchain technology can also improve the trust in and the efficiency of supply chain systems by allowing anyone to trace each product to its source, simply by looking up the records in a distributed digital ledger. The blockchain technology can also be used to create solid digital economies in gaming environments, where collectibles and other digital assets can be reliably owned, sold, and exchanged.

    Notwithstanding the rapidly evolving ecosystem of new applications, many commentators have described the blockchain as a "solution in search of a problem.” This seminar invites students to boldly fill this gap, by thinking at the blockchain technology at its maximum level of abstraction: as a tool to create, test and validate economic and governance designs.

    <br/><br/>
    <em>Topics:</em> Blockchain Technology, Different Blockchains, Consensus Mechanisms, Cryptocurrencies, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Tokenization, Governance, Privacy.

    <h4>Radical Markets</h4>

    The book <a href="http://radicalmarkets.com/" target="_blank">"Radical Markets"</a> by Posner and Weyl argues that wealthy countries face a triple social crisis of rising inequality, economic stagnation, and failing political legitimacy. This crisis results from a failure of ideas and it proposes a new set of policies labeled "Radical Markets” that are at once more free market than the right and more egalitarian than the left to reunite the classic liberal coalition. Radical Markets argues that expanding the scope of markets is the only way to reduce inequality, restore robust economic growth, and resolve political conflicts.  The final aim of the book is to show how the emancipatory force of genuinely open, free, and competitive markets can reawaken the dormant nineteenth-century spirit of liberal reform and lead to greater equality, prosperity, and cooperation. This seminar invites students to embrace the bold and radical vision put forward in this book to daringly develop new solutions to socio-economic problems, as well as to criticize and improve upon the solutions proposed by Posner and Weyl.

    <br/><br/>
    <em>Topics:</em> Private Property, Auctions, Quadratic Voting, Immigration Sponsorships, Antitrust Laws, Data Labor and Dignity.
